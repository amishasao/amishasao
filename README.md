## About me!
Hey everyone! I'm Amisha. I enjoy making things (involving both hardware and software), doing CS for research, designing aesthetic UIs, and running/attending hackathons. From tinkering with robotics to researching LLMOPs, programming has changed my outlook on the future of tech. My projects often have a creative or artsy UI:D

Away from school, I spend my time working with friends on Rock Hacks, working at the Applied Research Labs at UT, and playing sports!

Feel free to reach out!
