## About me!
Hey everyone! My name is Amisha, and I'm an Austinite. I enjoy making things (involving both hardware and software), doing CS for research, designing aesthetic UIs, and running/attending hackathons.

Away from school, I spend my time working with friends on Rock Hacks, working at the Applied Research Labs at UT, and playing sports!

Feel free to reach out!
